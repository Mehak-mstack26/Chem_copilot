# ChemCopilot ðŸ§ª

ChemCopilot is an advanced chemistry assistant that combines retrosynthesis pathway prediction with detailed reaction analysis. It helps chemists understand complex chemical reactions, predict synthesis routes, and analyze reaction mechanisms.

## Features and Components

### 1. RetroSynthesis Agent
- Predicts retrosynthesis pathways for target molecules
- Provides multiple synthesis routes with detailed reaction steps

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ChemCopilot.git
cd ChemCopilot
```

2. Add RetroSynthesis Agent as a subfolder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anujmst/RetroSynthesisAgent.git
```

3. Follow RetroSynthesis Agent setup instructions in their repository to configure the environment and dependencies.

4. Install ChemCopilot dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: ChemCopilot requires Python 3.11

## Architecture and Workflow

1. **Input Processing**
   - User provides target molecule (IUPAC or common name)
   - System validates and processes the input

2. **Retrosynthesis Prediction**
   - RetroSynthesis Agent analyzes the target molecule
   - Generates 3 possible synthesis pathways
   - Each pathway includes:
     - Reaction steps
     - Reactants and products
     - Reaction conditions
     - Reaction SMILES
     - Literature sources

3. **Reaction Analysis**
   - Extracts reaction SMILES from each pathway
   - For each reaction:
     - Identifies functional groups
     - Analyzes bond changes
     - Provides mechanistic insights
     - Generates comprehensive reaction information

4. **Output Generation**
   - Presents synthesis pathways with detailed analysis
   - Offers interactive exploration of reactions
   - Provides visualization options
