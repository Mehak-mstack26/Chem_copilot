# ChemCoPilot

**ChemCoPilot** is an AI-powered chemistry assistant where users can input diverse chemistry-related queries at both the **reaction level** and **molecule level**. It supports functional group detection, bond analysis, and overall understanding of reactions and molecular structures.

## ðŸ”¬ Features

- Query chemical information at the **reaction** or **molecule** level
- Perform **functional group** and **bond analysis** on any reaction
- Generate **reaction SMILES** from compound names
- Analyze reactions directly using powerful AI tools

## ðŸ§­ Workflow (UI Overview)

1. The workflow begins by **taking a compound name** as input.
2. Our **API processes** this input and returns **three outputs**.
3. These outputs are then passed through the **OpenAI API**, which generates their corresponding **reaction SMILES**.
4. The generated reaction SMILES are sent to the **second tab (Reaction Analysis)** for further processing, where the **final output** is generated.
5. Additionally, users can **directly enter simple queries** in the **second tab** to use specific tools without going through the first step.


## Tools & Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in this project:

* **LangChain:** For building applications with LLMs (Large Language Models).
* **OpenAI:** API for GPT-based models.
* **RDKit:** Python library for cheminformatics.
* **RXNMapper:** For mapping chemical reactions.
* **Streamlit:** For building the app's user interface.
* **Pydantic:** Data validation and settings management.
* **Requests:** For making HTTP requests.
* **Python-dotenv:** For loading environment variables from `.env`.


## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites:

* **Python version:** 3.9.18
* **Conda:** To install RDKit.

### Step-by-Step Setup:
1. First, **clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chemcopilot.git
    cd chemcopilot
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    To ensure a clean environment for your project, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. You can do so with the following commands:

    ```bash
    python3.9 -m venv chem_env
    source chem_env/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
    .\chem_env\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Once the virtual environment is set up, install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For RDKit, which is installed via conda, run:

    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge rdkit=2022.9.5
    ```

4.  **Set Up OpenAI API Key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the OpenAI API key as follows:

    ```ini
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
    ```

5.  **Running the Application:**
    To run the app, use the following Streamlit command:

    ```bash
    python -m streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This will start the Streamlit server, and you can view the application by navigating to the provided local URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`).
