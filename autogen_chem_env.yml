    # torch, torchvision, torchaudio will be pulled by transformers/rxnmapper
    # but let's add torch explicitly to guide its version if needed.
    # PyTorch version often depends on your system (CPU/GPU, OS).
    # For CPU on macOS arm64, a recent version should be fine.
    # If issues persist, you might need to install torch separately via pip after env creation
    # using the specific command from pytorch.org
    - torch>=2.0.0
